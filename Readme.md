# ➕➖ Math Engine ✖️➗

Welcome to **Math Engine**, an advanced mathematics engine which can solve all sorts of mathematical problems ranging from basic algebra to complex trignometry, geometry, calculus, arithmetic progressions, probability and much more built in Typescript and Python. 💯

---

## Features 🚀

- **Smart AI Built from Scratch**: Powered by a strong AI built from scratch *(no use of APIs)*, the engine can do some very smart tasks like generating equations from word problems, recognizing patterns in geometrical figures and applying logic to return mathematical proofs. 🧠
- **Generate question papers**: Generate questions papers with adjustable difficulty saving time for teachers and providing practise for students. 🤖
- **Solve Equations**: Solve any mathematical equation, be it quadratic, linear, single variated or a pair of linear equations in two variables. 🟰
- **Easy-to-Understand Solutions**: Use AI to give out easy to understand solutions in 8 different languages. 💡
- **Crazy UI**: Using Three.js and other similar technologies to create stunning 3D visualizations to make the topics and solutions easy to understand and provide crazy frontend. 🤯

## Technologies Used 🛠️

- **Frontend**: 
  - **Three.js** for rendering 3D objects on the screen. ⚪
- **Backend**: 
  - **Express.js** for the backend server. ⚫
- **Basic Maths-Execution**: 
  - **Typescript** to solve equations and do other simple tasks. ✖️
- **AI**: 
  - Smart AI engine built from scratch integrated for doing maths. 🧑‍💻

## Getting Started 💻

To run the project locally on your machine, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites 📦

Make sure you have the following installed:
- **Node.js** (version 14 or higher)

### Steps to Run Locally 

1. **Clone the repository**: 💯

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/samarth-agrawal-dev/math-engine.git
    cd math-engine
    ```
2. **Run build command**: 🏗️

    ```bash
    npm run build # this will compile typescript code to javascript code.
    ```

## Future Features 🚧

- 🤖 **AI** : is yet to be added 😅.
- 📊 **Logic** : There is no logic in the engine and it does long calculations instead of finding an optimized and quick solution.
- 📐 **Trignometry** and **other Geometrical Concepts.**
- 🎮 **Generating questions** for both students and teachers.
- ⚪ **Frontend**: For making it easy to use in a website or an app instead of in the terminal.
